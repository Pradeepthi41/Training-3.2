Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.
ans:-
a. Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the built-in data types provided by JavaScript. They represent single values and are not mutable. JavaScript supports the following primitive data types:

1. Number:
Number data type in JavaScript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without decimals.
example-
    let x = 250;
    let y = 40.5;
    console.log("Value of x=" + x);
    console.log("Value of y=" + y);
    output-
    Value of x=250
    Value of y=40.5

  2 String:
The string data type in JavaScript represents a sequence of characters that are surrounded by single or double quotes.

  let str = 'Hello All';
let str1 = "Welcome to my new house";
console.log("Value of str=" + str);
console.log("Value of str1=" + str1);

3 Undefined:
This means that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value, or it has been explicitly set to the value `undefined`.
example-
let x;
console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined

4 Boolean:
The boolean data type can accept only two values i.e. true and false.

5 Null:
This data type can hold only one possible value that is null.

6 BigInt:
BigInt data type can represent numbers greater than 253-1 which helps to perform operations on large numbers. The number is specified by writing ‘n’ at the end of the value


b. Non-primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are objects and derived data types. They can store collections of values or more complex entities. The two key non-primitive data types in JavaScript are:

Below is a list of Non-primitive data types.

1 Object:
An object in Javascript is an entity having properties and methods. Everything is an object in javascript.

2 Array:
With the help of an array, we can store more than one element under a single name.
example-
let a = new Array();
    let b = new Array(10);
    let d = new Array(1, 2, 3, "Hello");
    console.log("value of a=" + a);
    console.log("value of b" + b);
    console.log("value of d=" + d);
    output-
          value of a=
          value of b,,,,,,,,,
          value of d=1,2,3,Hello
