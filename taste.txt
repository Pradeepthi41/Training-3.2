1.variables
---python,java
--variables are like containers used to store the data/values/literals(data types)
--any kinds of data
--variable names 
types of variable
***********
1.var
2.let
3.const

example--
             var username =    "siddu";
              |     |             |
         variable  identifiers    value/data
-
code--
       a=5
       a=55
       print(a+a)
result--
       110 
(latest values will be considered)

--variables can starts with letters,_,$ also but not numbers.


* In your browser if we want to run javascript file or css file we must connet those files with html file.

so then create a html file(ex-index.html)

*why DOCTYPE is used in html.file
   -to make sure that version 5 (to specifies the version)
   -end user can not see the header session.

*console.log() : it is a method to print the output in  developer console.
*document.writeln() : it is a method to print the output on the UI.


*what is data types?
-datatypes used to specify what kind of data stored in the variable.

types of data types:-
*********************
1.primitive data types:-
- they are built-in
- immutable
- they can store only a single values
    -string
    -number
    -boolean
    -undefined
    -null
    -symbol
    -bigint

2.non-primtitive data types:-
- they are user defined
- mutable
- they can store multiple values.
    -array
    -functions
    -objects
    -math , date , json

Strings:-
**********
-sequence of characters enclosed within "" , '' , ``(template literals/backtiks)

number:-
- -2^53-1 to +2^53-1 upto this range we consider as number data type.
- beyond this range it will be bigint.

boolean :- true / false.

undefined:- variable is declared but not initialized with the value.

null:-null is empty value / absence of an object.
- return type of null is "object".

bigint:- any value exceed the range of number dattype we consider that as bigint.
- any value sufix with "n" will be bigint.

Operators:-
**************
- Operators is a special type of symbols used to perform some operations on operands.
ex - 10(operand1) +(operator) 20(operand2)

- unary
- binary
- ternary(operand1 ? operand2 : operand3)

1.arithmatic Operators
2.assignment operator
3.relational operator
4.logical operator

1.arithmatic Operators:-
- addition
- substraction
- multiplication
- division
- modulus
- expoenentail
- increment(++) :- increment will happen with one value
    - pre-increment :- increment before execution
    - post-increment :- increment after execution
- decrement(--) :- decrmenrted by 1
    - pre-decrement
    - post-decrement

concatenation :- adding two or more strings.
typecasting :- converting one datatype into another datatype.
NaN :- Not a Number :- 

2.assignment operator:-
- = , += , -= , *= ,/= , %= , **=

3.relational operator
- which are used to compare two values.
- == , === , != , !== , > , >= , < , <=
- returns always a boolean.
what is the difference between "==" and "==="?
-"==" - it will check only values not a data type.
-"===" - it will check both values and data types.
- "!=" - similar to == it will check only values not a data types
- "!==" - checks both value and data types.

4.Logical operators:-
AND(&&)- when both sides condition is true then it will return true else false.
OR(||) :- when both side is true or any one side is true it will return true else false.
NOT(!):- if true it becomes false and vice-versa. 

Decision making statments:-
****************************
-if:- it will work for true statments
- if else
- else if ladder
-switch
- ternary

prompt():- this method is used to collect the data from the users. 

Looping statement:-
*******************
--to execute the block of code repeatedly.
for loop :-
-will be used when the exact iteration count is known.
- minimum iteration count is "0"
synatx :-  for(initialization ; condition; updation){
            //statements
            }
while :-
- will be used when we dont know the iteration count.
- minimum iteration count is "0"
syntax :-  while(condition){
                //statements
            }
do-while:-
- will be used when we dont know the iteration count.
- minimum iteration count is "1"
syntax :-  do{
            //statements
            }while(condition)

what are entry controlled and exit controlled loops?
- entry controlled loops - for loop , while loop
- exit controlled loops - do-while loop

-what is the difference between "break" and "continue" keywords.
break - when condition satisfied it will terminate the loop
permenently

continue-when the condition satisfies it will skip that particular
condition.

functions:-
************
- function is a block of code used to execute specific task assigned to it.
- function is a non-primitive data type.
- functions can be reusable.

syntax :-    function function_name(optional parameters){// function decalration
                    //statements
                    }
                function_name(arguments);

Types of functions:-
*********************
1.named function :- function which is having a name and invoked with the same name.
2.anonymus function :-function which doesnot have  a name to declare and to invoke.
3.function expression:- anonymus function decalration is assigned to a variable 
    and invoked with the same variable.
4.Immediate invoke function expression(IIFE):-
    - once the function is created immediatley it should be invoked.
    - it can be executed only once.

5.Arrow function:-it is used to concise the normal function syntax.
syntax :-  ()=>{}; in es6 version 
- arrow function is similar to anonymus function.
6.Higher order function
7.Callback function
- closure


Note :- 
- current version of javascript is es14.
- es6 - is stable version
es - ECMA script
